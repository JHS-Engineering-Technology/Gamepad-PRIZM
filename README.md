# TETRIX PRIZM Gamepad Library

A simple, hardware-abstracted Arduino library for reading a TETRIX RC receiver with a PRIZM controller. It handles all the signal processing (trim, deadband) and provides clean joystick values from **-100 to 100**.

This library provides a default mapping for a common "tank drive" or "arcade drive" setup:
* **Left  Stick X-Axis (TETRIX RECEIVER Ch4):** Port A1
* **Left  Stick Y-Axis (TETRIX RECEIVER Ch2):** Port A2
* **Right Stick Y-Axis (TETRIX RECEIVER Ch3):** Port A3

## ⚠️ Prerequisite: Install "PRIZM" Library

Before you can use this library, you **must** install the official "PRIZM" library by TETRIX Robotics.

1.  In the Arduino IDE, go to **Tools > Manage Libraries...**
2.  Search for `PRIZM` and install the library.

## Installation (Choose One)

You only need to install the `Gamepad` library using **one** of the methods below.

### Method 1 (Recommended): Download from GitHub

This is the easiest way to get the latest stable version.

1.  Go to the library's GitHub page: [**github.com/JHS-Engineering-Technology/Gamepad-PRIZM/releases**](https://github.com/JHS-Engineering-Technology/Gamepad-PRIZM/releases)
2.  Under the latest release, click `Gamepad.zip` to download the library.
3.  In the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...**
4.  Select the `Gamepad.zip` file you just downloaded.

### Method 2: Install from Google Drive

1.  Download the `Gamepad.zip` file from the Google Drive link provided by your instructor.
2.  In the Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...**
3.  Select the `Gamepad.zip` file you downloaded.

## How to Use

Once installed, you can find a complete, working example:

1.  Go to **File > Examples > Gamepad > TankDrive**.
2.  This sketch will show you how to initialize the library and read the joystick values to control a simple tank-drive robot.
